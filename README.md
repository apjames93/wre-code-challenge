# Woodriver Energy Code Challenge
Hello and welcome! The task at hand is to implement a small React web application that consumes "articles", displays them, and can update them. You'll be fetching sorted JSON data directly from our API.

## Requirements
1. As a user I should be able to open the application and view articles
2. As a user I should be able to see all of associated data (fields) on a displayed `Article` except for `id` and `user_id`
3. As a user I should have the ability to `update` articles

_Note:_ This is a front-end & design focused challenge. In other words, we are giving you __no__ visual requirements! Excited to see what  you come up with.

## Bonus
- Use SASS or LESS to pre-compile your CSS
- Add some CSS animation with transitions
- Utilize other GraphQL endpoints to expand the requested feature set
- Use redux
- Deploy your challenge somewhere live

## Things to keep in mind ðŸš¨
* Features are less important than code quality. Put more focus on code quality and less on speed and number of features implemented.
* Your code will be evaluated based on: code structure, programming best practices, legibility (and not number of features implemented or speed).
* The git commit history (and git commit messages) will be also evaluated.
* Do not forget to include a few details about your code challenge in the README (e.g explain choice of libraries, how to run it ...)
* Please do not spend more than 4-5 hours on this max! Again you are not being evaluated on speed/number of features.

## Acessing the code challenge API
- Explore the API docs [here](https://wre-code-challenge.herokuapp.com/graphiql)
- The publically facing GraphQL API endpoint for you to consume from is: `https://wre-code-challenge.herokuapp.com/graphql`
